        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-pink-300 mb-2">Your Payment Info</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          We offer payments in crypto and using credit card.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          Crypto payments are made directly by sending funds to a crypto address we provide. On our backend, we do not process any of your identity related to that payment, such as your address or other personal details.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          The payment address is provided by <strong>NOWPayments</strong>, which proxies your payment by nature, so no direct payment will be visible on the blockchain.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          However, when you request a refund, we will retrieve your address via NOWPayments to return the funds.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          Credit card, Google Pay, and other payments are handled by <strong>Paddle</strong>. On our side, we mainly process your payment status, but might access necessary information which is processed and saved by Paddle, not directly by us.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          Your last order ID and last purchase info like status and date are linked to your user ID and stored permanently by nature.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          You can request removal of this data by opening a support ticket. Removal from Paddle and our system might take 1–7 business days.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-pink-300 mb-2">Your Online Identity</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          Your email is linked to your account permanently unless you delete your account.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          Your IP address is not linked to your account but is processed for security and abuse prevention.

        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          We do not use tracking or advertising cookies, only session cookies.

        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          Your messages are visible to admins to ensure compliance with our Terms of Service. Your last 24 hours of messages are stored temporarily to prevent abuse and then permanently deleted.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          Chats you join using bots are controlled by you. When you exit a chat or drop an instance, the chat record is deleted entirely and permanently.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 mb-2">
          Bots leave any chat you remove. Chats and bots are not visible or accessible to our staff.
